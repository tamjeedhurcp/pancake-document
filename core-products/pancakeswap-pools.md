# Pools

\*\*\*\***SkySwap pools** allow you to provide liquidity by adding your tokens to liquidity pools or “LPs”.

When you add your token to a liquidity pool \(LP\), you will receive FLIP tokens \(SkySwap's version of liquidity provider tokens\).

As an example, if you deposited $SKY and $BNB into a liquidity pool, you would receive SKY-BNB FLIP tokens.

The number of FLIP tokens you receive represents your portion of the SKY-BNB liquidity pool. You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.  
[“Simply put, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet.” - Nate Hindman](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)

It’s not all bad for liquidity providers as you will also be given a reward in the form of trading fees. Whenever someone trades SkySwap, the trader pays a 0.2% fee, of which 0.17% is added to the liquidity pool of the swap pair they traded on.

For example:

* There are 10 FLIP tokens representing 10 Sky and 10 BNB tokens.
* 1 FLIP token = 1 SKY + 1 BNB
* Someone trades 10 SKY for 10 BNB.
* Someone else trades 10 BNB for 10 SKY.
* The CAKE/BNB liquidity pool now has 10.017 SKY and 10.017 BNB.
* Each FLIP token is now worth 1.00017 SKY + 1.00017 BNB.

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your FLIP tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield on the SKY farms \(here\), while still earning your 0.17% trading fee reward.
